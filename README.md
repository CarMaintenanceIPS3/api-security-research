## Introduction

API security is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring the proper functioning of web applications. This repository aims to provide developers with guidelines and recommendations for designing and implementing secure APIs. We cover various aspects of API security, including access control models, authentication, authorization, and common security threats and their mitigation techniques.

## Access Control Models

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Function-Level Authorization

## Authentication Techniques

- OAuth Tokens
  - Reference Tokens
  - Self-contained Tokens (JSON Web Tokens - JWT)

## Authorization Techniques

- Centralizing Authorization Policies
- Using Policy Decision Points (e.g., Open Policy Agent)

## Security Threats and Mitigation

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Best Practices for Secure API Design
